**For the second assignment in Johanâ€™s studio, we are required to collect data about ourselves for a week and visualize it in two ways: one visualization focused on the aspect of time and another focused on the aspect of location. We first create a manual visualization by developing various sketches based on the collected data. Afterward, we digitize these visualizations using Adobe Illustrator and present them as a poster in InDesign.**
