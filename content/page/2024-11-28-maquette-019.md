*During my time as an interior design student, I discovered the importance of combining technical skills with creative inspiration to bring design concepts to life. One of the most rewarding projects I completed during the Interior Design program involved reconstructing a building in scale, with a focus on precision and aesthetics. This process not only helped me refine my technical abilities but also allowed me to express my personal design vision.*

\
For the Design course, I took on the challenge of recreating Building 019, a former industrial site in Dok Noord, Ghent. Using wood and laser-cutting techniques, I carefully crafted a scaled model of the building, ensuring a detailed and accurate representation. I drew inspiration from the organic forms of renowned artist Richard Serra to design an interior that balanced the buildingâ€™s industrial character with sculptural, flowing spaces. This project provided an excellent opportunity to explore the relationship between functionality and form while pushing the boundaries of my creativity.

\
The result of this project was a model that reflected both my technical expertise and my ability to interpret and reimagine spatial dynamics. By blending industrial architecture with organic artistry, I created a piece that showcased the versatility and creativity of interior design. This project was not only a technical challenge but also an opportunity to express my unique perspective as a designer, highlighting my passion for creating meaningful and inspiring spaces.
