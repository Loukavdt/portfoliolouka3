# This model was created for the Design course as part of the Interior Design program.
# Building 019, a former industrial site in Dok Noord, Ghent, was reconstructed to scale
# using wood and the laser-cutting technique. The interior design draws inspiration from
# the organic forms of artist Richard Serra. The result is a model that reflects both the
# industrial characteristics and the flowing, sculptural interior spaces.
