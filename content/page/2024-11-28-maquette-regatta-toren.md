*Designing spaces that respond to specific user needs is one of the most fulfilling aspects of interior design. During my studies, I had the chance to explore this through a hands-on project for the Design course, where I focused on creating a scale model of the Regatta Tower at the Watersportbaan in Ghent. This project challenged me to merge creativity with functionality, resulting in a design tailored to its unique context.*

\
The scale model of the Regatta Tower was entirely hand-cut, using a variety of materials such as wood, concrete, plexiglass, and metal. Every element of the design was carefully considered to reflect the towerâ€™s purpose: providing a functional yet welcoming space for fishermen. The sleeping accommodations offered overnight comfort, while the open kitchen on the ground floor served as a central hub. This kitchen was designed as a gathering spot where fishermen could prepare and share their catch, fostering a sense of connection and community. The location of the tower and its thoughtful design made it an ideal base for those visiting the Watersportbaan.

\
This project resulted in a detailed and carefully crafted model that captured both the aesthetic and practical aspects of the Regatta Tower. It was a valuable learning experience that taught me how to create spaces that serve specific user groups while maintaining a focus on design quality. By balancing technical precision with a user-centered approach, I was able to deliver a piece that reflects my growing skills and passion for thoughtful interior design.
