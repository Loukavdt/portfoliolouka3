*As part of my studies in Graphic Design, I worked on the second assignment in Inge’s course, where the task was to create and design a catalog for the exhibition ‘Onderkruipsels, Kleyne Dierkens in Kunst en Wetenschap’ at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. This project allowed me to explore editorial design while considering both aesthetic and practical aspects of a publication.*

\
The assignment gave me the freedom to determine the catalog's format, proportions, and number of pages, provided the page count was a multiple of four. The selection of fonts was entirely up to me, allowing for a creative exploration of typography. However, the context of the exhibition remained a crucial consideration, as the catalog was intended for visitors to view and take home.

My task included designing the cover, the interior layout, and the back cover. The exhibition text was provided, giving me the opportunity to focus entirely on the visual and structural elements of the catalog. I aimed to create a cohesive design that reflected the theme of the exhibition, combining clarity with visual appeal to engage the audience while ensuring functionality.

\
This assignment was a valuable exercise in editorial design, pushing me to balance creative freedom with the practical requirements of a publication. It enhanced my understanding of layout, typography, and the importance of context in design. Through this project, I gained insights into how thoughtful design choices can elevate the experience of printed materials.
