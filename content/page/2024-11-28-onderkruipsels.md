**For the second assignment in Inge’s studio, we are tasked with creating and designing a catalog for the exhibition ‘Onderkruipsels, Kleyne Dierkens in Kunst en Wetenschap’ at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.**\
**We are free to determine the format, number of pages, and proportions of the catalog, as long as the page count is a multiple of four. The choice of fonts is also entirely up to us. However, it is important to consider the context of the exhibition, as the catalog will be viewed and taken by visitors. We will design the cover, the interior, and the back cover. The text itself will be provided to us.**
