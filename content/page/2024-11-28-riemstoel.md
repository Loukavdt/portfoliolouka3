**For an assignment in collaboration with the company Luxor in Maldegem, the challenge was to design a chair. A basic chair frame was provided, and the task was to modify it to make it functional and comfortable to sit on. Leather belts were chosen as the primary material, woven into a sturdy pattern and attached to the frame. This weaving not only ensured a stable seat but also gave the chair a unique and warm aesthetic. Additionally, the chair was crafted sustainably by using second-hand belts and a repurposed frame.**
