*During my studies as an Interior Designer, I worked on an assignment in collaboration with Luxor, a company based in Maldegem, where the task was to design a chair. This project provided me with an opportunity to explore both functionality and aesthetics in furniture design, focusing on creating a piece that was both practical and visually appealing.*

\
For the assignment, a basic chair frame was provided, and my challenge was to modify it to create a functional and comfortable seating solution. I chose leather belts as the primary material, weaving them into a sturdy pattern and attaching them to the frame. The weaving technique not only ensured a stable seat but also added a unique and warm aesthetic to the chair. In addition, I focused on making the chair sustainably by using second-hand belts and a repurposed frame, contributing to the overall environmental impact of the design.

This project was a valuable experience in furniture design, allowing me to balance creativity with practical considerations. By focusing on functionality, aesthetics, and sustainability, I was able to create a chair that was both comfortable to use and visually distinctive. The assignment helped me refine my design process and consider the broader implications of materials and production methods.
