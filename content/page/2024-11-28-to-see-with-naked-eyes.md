*As part of my studies in Graphic Design, I participated in the course "To See with Naked Eyes," the first assignment in Inge’s course. This project was divided into two parts: one guided by Inge and the other by Jan. The assignment provided an opportunity to explore color in both two-dimensional and interactive forms, blending observation, experimentation, and technical development.*

\
In Inge’s part of the assignment, we focused on observing and capturing colors in our surroundings through photography, specifically architectural elements or objects. From the photographs taken, I selected a top 10 that became the foundation for creating custom color palettes. Using acrylic paint, I mixed and poured these palettes into a medium and paired them with descriptive text, allowing the colors to be contextualized and appreciated as a cohesive study.

In Jan’s part, the focus shifted toward an interactive application of color. I chose one of seven predefined color contrasts to develop the concept for an installation in the Spatial Computing Lab. The emphasis was on creating an immersive experience where the perception of the color contrast was central. The visual effects supporting this experience were developed in a later phase, allowing the interaction with color to take precedence.

This assignment was an enriching exploration of color theory and its applications in design and interaction. From observing and replicating colors in physical media to designing an interactive experience, I gained a deeper understanding of how color affects perception and space. The project also highlighted the versatility of color as both an artistic and functional element in design.
