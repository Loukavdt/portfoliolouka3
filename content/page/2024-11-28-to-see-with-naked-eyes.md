**"To See with Naked Eyes" is the first assignment in Inge's studio, consisting of two parts: one by Inge and one by Jan.**

**In Inge’s part, we capture photographic observations of colors in our surroundings, focusing on architectural elements or objects. From these, we select a top 10 photos to serve as the basis for creating custom color palettes using acrylic paint. These palettes are poured into a medium and paired with accompanying text.**

**In Jan’s part, we choose one of seven color contrasts as the foundation for an interactive installation in the Spatial Computing Lab. The experience of the color contrast takes center stage, with the visual effects being developed later.**
