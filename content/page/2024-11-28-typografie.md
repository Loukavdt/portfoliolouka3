**Typography is the first assignment in Johan’s studio.**\
**We will explore how to make a short text as readable and visually appealing as possible, how to combine text and images, and how to adapt our design for different media. We are tasked with displaying a quote from a designer in the book *“Designer Maker User”* from the London Design Museum across various media formats: a book spread, a poster, an Instagram post (both animated and non-animated), and one slide. Alongside the quote, we will include the designer's name, a brief biography, and the source citation. For each medium, we will design one version with an image and one without. We must ensure that all media are designed in the same style for a cohesive look.**
