*As part of my studies in Graphic Design, I worked on an assignment in Johan’s course that focused on typography. This project introduced me to the challenge of combining readability with visual appeal, while also adapting designs across different media formats. It was an opportunity to deepen my understanding of typography and its role in effective communication.*

\
The task revolved around a quote from a designer featured in the book *"Designer Maker User"* from the London Design Museum. We were required to present the quote, the designer’s name, a brief biography, and the source citation across several media formats: a book spread, a poster, an Instagram post (animated and non-animated), and a slide. Each format demanded a unique design approach while maintaining a cohesive style across all outputs.

To achieve this, I focused on creating designs that balanced the interplay between text and image. Each medium had two variations—one including an image and one without—ensuring consistency and adaptability. Throughout the project, I paid close attention to typography, experimenting with layout, hierarchy, and spacing to maximize both readability and aesthetic quality.

This assignment offered valuable insights into the complexities of typography and multi-platform design. It taught me how to create cohesive visuals that adapt seamlessly across formats while retaining a clear, unified style. This project not only enhanced my technical skills but also emphasized the importance of thoughtful typographic choices in effective design.
