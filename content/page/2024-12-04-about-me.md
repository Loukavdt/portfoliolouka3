I am Louka, 22 years old, currently pursuing an academic bachelor's degree in Media and Information Design. Before this, I studied interior design for a year and a half, but I discovered that my passion lies more in visual communication and storytelling through design. In my free time, I enjoy drawing and can often be found on my BMX or skateboard. These hobbies give me freedom and inspiration. With my creativity and eye for detail, I aim to create unique designs in the future that resonate with people. Until then, Iâ€™ll keep enjoying what I do and learning every day.
