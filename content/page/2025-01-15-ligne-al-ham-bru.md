*During Gitteâ€™s course in my graphic design studies, I participated in a data visualization assignment titled Ligne Al-ham-bru, focusing on the Alhambra district in Brussels. This project explored the theme of seduction within the social, cultural, and economic aspects of the neighborhood. It offered an opportunity to combine storytelling, design, and interactive media to create an immersive experience for a public audience.*

\
The assignment began with a deep dive into the Alhambra district. Through observations and conversations with residents, we collected data and stories to uncover patterns and hidden narratives about the role of seduction in the neighborhood. These insights formed the foundation for our creative work, which could take various forms, such as videos, photographs, texts, or other mediums. Each group collaborated with a partner and selected a medium suited to the interactive bus that served as the centerpiece of the project. This could include projections on the bus, audio installations, transparent prints, or even physical objects integrated into the bus. The design work culminated in an interactive installation that was showcased during the light festival in Brussels. Visitors were invited to explore the Alhambra district through the lens of seduction, offering a fresh perspective on the neighborhood and its stories.

\
This project was a unique opportunity to blend data visualization, storytelling, and interactive design. By immersing myself in the Alhambra district and working collaboratively to create an engaging experience, I gained valuable insights into how design can evoke curiosity, provoke thought, and connect people with unfamiliar places and narratives. It reinforced the power of design as a tool for both discovery and communication.
