*As part of Johan’s course in my graphic design studies, I worked on an assignment centered around book design. The task revolved around The Twice-Burned Library, an excerpt from Richard Ovenden’s ‘Burning the Books: A History of Knowledge Under Attack.’ This assignment offered a unique opportunity to explore editorial design, storytelling, and craftsmanship in bookbinding.*

\
The project required us to design a complete book based on the provided text, complemented by visuals. These images could be sourced from the book *‘Universiteitsbibliotheek Leuven, 1425-2000,’* or be entirely self-created. The visual elements could be integrated within the text or presented separately as image essays, providing flexibility in how the narrative unfolded. The book design included several essential components, such as a title page, copyright information, an explanation of the assignment, quotes, and the main text combined with the imagery. The final sections contained an author biography, image credits, and a colophon. Additionally, the cover, back cover, and spine displayed the book’s title, author’s name, and publisher, with the freedom to choose between a hardcover or softcover. The assignment allowed for complete creative freedom regarding the book’s format and paper choice, as long as the design adhered to proper sectioning and pagination. A workshop on bookbinding was integrated into the course, giving me hands-on experience in assembling a bound copy of the book. The final outcome was a professionally bound book, submitted and presented to the jury in January.

\
This project was an immersive experience that combined technical skills, design thinking, and craftsmanship. From conceptualizing the book’s layout to physically binding it, the assignment deepened my understanding of editorial design and the intricate details that go into producing a cohesive, engaging publication. It also highlighted the balance between creative freedom and practical constraints, essential skills for any graphic designer.
