*During Gijsâ€™s course in my graphic design studies, I worked on an assignment focused on creating a compelling data visualization. The goal was to present complex information in a clear and engaging way, combining multiple data aspects into one cohesive visual. This assignment challenged me to explore how design can transform raw data into meaningful insights for the viewer.*

\
The focus of the assignment was on the Olympic Games. We were encouraged to use historical data, such as information about past Olympics, or data from the recent 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Alternatively, we had the freedom to source our own dataset, as long as it was relevant to the theme. The task involved combining various aspects of the data, such as age, names, birthplaces, and other details, to create a visualization that was both informative and easy to navigate. We were free to choose the medium for our visualization, which allowed for creativity in execution. Options included an infographic poster, an animated video, an interactive website, or any other innovative format that suited the data and the intended audience. The assignment emphasized clarity, storytelling, and design. It required a thoughtful balance between aesthetics and functionality to ensure the visualization effectively communicated the underlying data while remaining visually appealing and engaging.

\
This project provided valuable insights into the field of data visualization. It taught me how to approach complex datasets, extract key insights, and present them in a way that is both accessible and impactful. By experimenting with different mediums and design techniques, I developed a deeper appreciation for the role of data visualization in design and its ability to transform information into a compelling narrative.
